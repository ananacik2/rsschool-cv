### Briefly about myself :
Currently, I am studying Russian philology at the university. I work as a sales consultant. In my free time, I dedicate myself to learning foreign languages, watching movies/series, playing chess, and reading books. I enjoy discovering new things, and sometimes I jokingly say that I want to know everything there is to know. But, as Socrates said: "I know that I know nothing." I am also interested in  programming.

### Code example  : 
Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. 0 is neither positive nor negative.

If the input is an empty array or is null, return an empty array.


` function countPositivesSumNegatives(input)  { `
   
   ` let positiveCount = 0; `
   
   ` let sumOfNegative = 0; ` 

    if (input.length === 0) {
        return [];
    }

    input.forEach((el) => {
        if (el > 0) {
            positiveCount++;
        }
        if (el < 0) {
            sumOfNegative += el;
        }
    });

   ` return [positiveCount, sumOfNegative]; `

` } `
